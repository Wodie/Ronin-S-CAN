# Ronin S CAN protocol


This project shows what I found about Ronin-S CAN protocol. It is not a working or complete code, as I am missing a lot of information. The must important feature that need to be found is the CRC-16 settings used, so a device can validate external data. I expect that after CRC is right, I will be able to debug a lot of information and make an external controller code for Arduino, etc.

Remember this is NOT for the Ronin RS-2 head.
